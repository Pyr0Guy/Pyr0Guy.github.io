            Project Drive was a graduation project for one of my friends. 
            As a result, in a month we made a platformer inspired by 
            Wario Land 4 and Pizza Tower. In this project, I coded 
            the movement of the character for a very long time and at that 
            time it was really good, now I understand what I can do better. 
            As a result, due to bad game design and unfinished movement, 
            the development of the game was abandoned, and as a result, 
            the source code of the game was lost, and with it the 
            English version of the game, only Russian remained.

            Panophobia (fear of everything) - was a game for 
            Bare Jams Spring 2023 with "randomly generated rooms" 
            that change when you exit them. The gameplay of the game 
            consists in the passage of a huge cave, consisting of randomly 
            selected rooms, forming a network of levels in which the game 
            takes place. Before the game, the player has a choice between 
            three fears. In the future, we plan to rewrite and expand the game

            “FNF FREE DOWNLOAD Ico Tab Mod” is not just another 
            stupid and boring FNF mod. This is a FNF mod FREE DOWNLOAD 
            parody of FNF made by Tyler mon on GameMaker. I especially like 
            the style of this game which was painted in Paint and looks amazing.
            Also for this mod, I heavily remade the original game,which later
            became a separate engine created to simplify the creation of mods
            I think this project is my favorite.

            Ike's Mail Service - was created for GMTK Game Jam 2022 
            and is my first GameMaker project. The game is a random clicker. 
            Although now I understand how boring the game is, but for my 
            first game made in 48 hours, it is not bad
        </p>

            Dungeon & Talking - made for GMTK Game Jam 2023
            and is the ugly duckling of my career as I didn't make it in 48 hours. 
            In the game, you played as a Gamemaster. Communicating with players, 
            you watched how they fought monsters and made decisions on a random basis. 
            Although it was not finished, I am proud that I was able to write a primitive 
            artificial intelligence that could make decisions depending on its character.
